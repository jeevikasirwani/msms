I was a good player of Basketball along with Gymnastics. Basketball is my favorite sport and it developed  agility, speed, dodging ability and to take more and more in life.
This game teaches us that if we want to be successful in life, our quality should be high. Basketball is considered to be the fastest game among other sports and therefore as many people as possible should come to the basketball ground so that everyone can get their fitness and entertainment by playing the game. As a member of msm's basketball sports association, I invite all people to come and play basketball at marathvada sanskritik mandal's basketball ground..
